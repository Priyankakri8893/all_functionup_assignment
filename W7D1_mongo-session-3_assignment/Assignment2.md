Assignment 2:-
Read up ref and populate after the class and write a 2 line summary on the same. We will pick this up tomorrow so no need to discuss this in your mentor sessions today. 

=>  In Mongoose, ref and populate are used to create and manage relationships between different models. ref is used to specify a reference to another model, while populate is used to retrieve the referenced documents and fill them in a document.
