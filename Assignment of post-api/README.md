Assignments(Structure of the routes file would look like what is given at the bottom of the document):
You have to write a POST apis:
Write the api in first project directory (Routes/index.js or routes/route.js)
Problem Statement 1 :
NOTE: you must create the players array outside( on the top ) of the api( so that data is maintained across api hits )
Your player collection should be an ARRAY of player objects. Each player object should have the following attributes:
{
"name": "manish",
"dob": "1/1/1995",
"gender": "male",
"city": "jalandhar",
"sports": [
"swimming"
]
}


Write a POST /players api that creates a new player ( i.e. that saves a player’s details and doesn’t allow saving the data of a player with a name that already exists in the data)

NOTE: you must create the players array outside( on the top ) of the api( so that data is maintained across api hits)
