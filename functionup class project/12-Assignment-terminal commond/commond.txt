Problem 1:
- Create a folder called ‘assignment’
mkdir assignment
- Inside ‘assignment’ create 2 folders ‘source’ and ‘destination’
cd assignment
mkdir source
mkdir destination
- Inside ‘source’ create a text file using a command ( not manually)
cd source
touch note.txt 
- Add content in the text file
cat >> note.txt
my name is priyanka
press ctrl+d+d
- copy the contents of ‘source’ folder in ‘destination’ using cp command
cd ..
cp source/note.txt destination
End result : both the folders source and destination should have the same file
cd source
ls
cd ..
cd destination
ls
 


Problem 2:
- Remove the above file from ‘destination’ folder
rm note.txt
- Move the file from ‘source’ to ‘destination’
cd ..
mv source/note.txt destination
End result: Only destination folder should have the file.
cd source
ls
cd ..
cd destination
ls
