// Q1. This code will not run as expected. This is because the push() method returns the new length of the array, not the modified array. Therefore, when we try to call filter() on the result of push(), we will get an error because filter() is not a method of the number data type.

// Q2. When we run the code, we get the following error:

// vbnet
// Copy code
// TypeError: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].filter is not a function
// This error occurs because we are trying to call the filter() method on the result of push(), which is not an array.

// Q3. To fix the code, we can split the push() and filter() methods into separate statements like so:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// numbers.push(6);
// const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
// Here, we first define the numbers array, push the number 6 onto it using the push() method, and then use the filter() method to create a new array called evenNumbers that contains only the even numbers from the numbers array.

// Note that we have also simplified the filterOddNumbers() function to a one-liner using an arrow function that directly returns the result of the % operator.
