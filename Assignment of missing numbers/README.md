### Backend cohort Mar, 2023



Assignment question:=>

Note: The below questions are very commonly asked in nodejs interviews 

 Q1.
   // -write an api which gives the missing number in an array of integers starting from 1….e.g [1,2,3,5,6,7] : 4 is missing
 // Your route code will look like this
 app.get("/sol1", function (req, res) {
	   //logic : sum of numbers is n(n+1)/2..so get sum of all numbers in array. now take sum of numbers till last digit in the array
	   let arr= [1,2,3,5,6,7]
	   let missingNumber
 
	   ///LOGIC WILL GO HERE 
	   res.send(  { data: missingNumber  }  );
 });
 
 
 Q2. 
   // -write an api which gives the missing number in an array of integers starting from anywhere….e.g [33, 34, 35, 37, 38]: 36 is missing
 // Your route code will look like this
 app.get("/sol2", function (req, res) {
		   //logic : sum of n consecutive numbers is [ n * (first + last) / 2  ]..so get sum of all numbers in array. now take sum of n consecutive numbers.. n would be length+1 as 1 number is missing
		   let arr= [33, 34, 35, 37, 38]
		   let missingNumber
 
		   ///LOGIC WILL GO HERE 
  
		   res.send(  { data: missingNumber  }  );
 });
